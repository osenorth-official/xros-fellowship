## Welcome to the AR Personal Assistant.
This project aims to make a personal assistant that utilizes Augmented Reality (AR) technology to help users answer their daily queries and perform tasks with a human touch. The AR feature allows users to interact with the assistant in a more immersive and interactive way, making the experience more engaging.

Some of the use-cases for this assistant include:

Getting directions or recommendations in a virtual environment
Setting reminders or alarms
Playing music or media, and answering questions
In addition to these everyday tasks, the assistant also has potential for educational and training purposes. Users can learn new skills or information in a virtual augmented environment, making the learning experience more interactive and engaging.

We are excited to see the potential of this AR assistant and hope it can make a positive impact in people's daily lives. Stay tuned for updates and release!
